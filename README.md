•	Tautomerism of Acetone
•	Diels-Alder reaction between ethylene and butadiene

Problem 2. Calculate and plot the relative energies for the following C11H22 isomers

Problem 3. Perform conformational analysis for the following dihedral angles of n-hexane(see figure 1). Choose appropriate step sizes and identify various points of interest(staggered, eclipsed etc).

•	Dihedral angle formed by the carbons 1,2,3,4
•	Dihedral angle formed by the carbons 3,4,5,6
•	2D scan of the above two dihedral angles

Problem 5. Read the attached study on ”The intrinsic reaction coordinate”. Perform IRC scans for the reactions described in the paper and draw comparisions.

Problem 6. Formic acid (H-COOH) exists as a dimer in gas phase.
(a) Obtain the structure for the dimer and
(b) Provide an energetic basis for why it is found as dimers and not as monomers.

Problem 6. Model the Diels-Alder reaction (including the transition state) between cyclopent-1,3-ene and ethene with HF method with STO-3G basis set and provide all important information.
