Problem 3. Perform conformational analysis for the following dihedral angles of n-hexane(see figure 1). Choose appropriate step sizes and identify various points of interest(staggered, eclipsed etc).
•	Dihedral angle formed by the carbons 1,2,3,4
•	Dihedral angle formed by the carbons 3,4,5,6
•	2D scan of the above two dihedral angles
Problem 4. Calculate the vibrational spectrum of ethanol. Perform normal mode analysis and assign major peaks in the experimental spectrum(see figure 2) through comparisons.
